NGL Viewer is a web application for molecular visualization. [WebGL](https://get.webgl.org/) is employed to displays molecules like proteins and DNA/RNA with a variety of representations. Further, a server is included that enables remote access and animation of coordinate trajectories, for instance, from molecular dynamics simulations.

* Density volumes (MRC/MAP/CCP4)
* User interaction (mouse picking, selection language, image export)
* Coordinate trajectories (animation, server)
* Embeddable (single file, API)


Acknowledgments
===============

This project would not be possible without recourse to many fine open-source projects. Especially the [three.js](http://threejs.org/) project provides a great foundation. See [here](http://proteinformatics.charite.de/ngl/doc/index.html#User_manual/Development/Acknowledgment) for a detailed list of acknowledgments.


Changelog
